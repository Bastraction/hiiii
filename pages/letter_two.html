            I know this may seem a lot right now, and it is completely fine if you do not want to read this. I just felt the need to make you something because I truly do love you so much. Getting to use what I have been learning to further improve this site with you in mind is amazing,
            and I hope to continue to add onto this. You can click the buttons below and they go through several sections of why I love you so much. I hope you like this.

            Hello cutie. This letter will be formatted in the view of you as my best friend. I know it can be a lot when I am always love bombing you, however I do want you to know that I do not only just see you romantically, but as my best friend.
            There has been no one in this world that has ever been there for me as much as you have. You are always the first there, the first to listen, the first everything and I can not thank you enough. I never knew I would have such an amazing friend as you in my life.
            I have already told you that all my life I have struggled with friends, I mean my early life I had none and was a very lonely kid other than with my siblings. Suddenly time flies, and now here I am, with the best person in the world as my best friend.
            The way you are so caring for me, the way you listen to me, our indefinite fun times together, I never knew I would have someone like that in my life. You make me really happy, and I can be truly myself around you which feels so refreshing. I do not have to fake anything,
            you're true to me and I get to be true to you. You have made the past few years worth living in every way, and I thank you for that. You are truly my best friend.
