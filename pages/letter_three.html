            I know this may seem a lot right now, and it is completely fine if you do not want to read this. I just felt the need to make you something because I truly do love you so much. Getting to use what I have been learning to further improve this site with you in mind is amazing,
            and I hope to continue to add onto this. You can click the buttons below and they go through several sections of why I love you so much. I hope you like this.

            Hello. Are you happy with what I made you? I really hope you are. I even made this site possible to add more sections whenever I wanted so adding letters to you will be super easy!
            This letter, does not have any structure or theme. I just, am so happy I have you. I am so proud of you every day of all of your hard work, you are amazing. You are beautiful, you are stunning, gorgeous, sexy, perfect.
            You are so humble about it too, but you are every reason to boast because you truly are the best. You are incredibly funny, you have amazing taste in music, even all of your habits are amazing and it just, well amazes me.
            I did not know that every part of a person could be perfection, but after knowing you I can see that that's what you are. I know I may be really flirty with you, I mean can you blame me? I really hope you do not mind it, because I can't help myself.
            Your eyes are filled with the beauty of the universe, so captivating and makes me want to explore and see more of you. I miss you cutie, I hope you liked these letters.
