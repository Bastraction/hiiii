            I know this may seem a lot right now, and it is completely fine if you do not want to read this. I just felt the need to make you something because I truly do love you so much. Getting to use what I have been learning to further improve this site with you in mind is amazing,
            and I hope to continue to add onto this. You can click the buttons below and they go through several sections of why I love you so much. I hope you like this.

            Hello my love, you may be surprised that I made you this, or maybe not I mean you know how much I love you. Anyways, I just wanna say that within this first letter, that I love you with all my heart. I know you have heard me say this A LOT recently, and each time I say it it becomes more and more true.
            I know we have had a rough past week, and it sucks but together we can get through anything. We're soulmates, we're best friends, and while I know for now just friends, I hope in the future we are very happily married. I love you a lot, I think about you every day. There is not an hour that goes by that I do not think about you.
            I smile every time I see the photos of you on my home screens, the photo of you behind my phone, because you genuinely make me so happy. I do not know what I would do without you, you make my world go around and I could not ask for anyone else to fill the gap that you fill in my life.
            I am honored to be as important as I am to you, and I am happy that the feeling is mutual. I love you so much. I know this letter is short, there are 2 more for whenever you want / can read them. I love you.
